> **Interactive learning platform that helps developers master JavaScript through curated problems, step-by-step explanations, and AI-powered assistance.**

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **Advanced JavaScript Problem Solver** is a modern, single‑page application built with React and Vite that organizes hundreds of JavaScript coding challenges into intuitive categories. Each problem is accompanied by:

- ✅ Clearly written descriptions
- 🧠 Walk‑through explanations
- 🛠️ Reference solvers
- 🤖 An AI assistant for hints, clarifications, and code suggestions (powered by Google Generative AI)

This repository serves both as an educational tool for learners and as a demonstration of integrating generative AI into a frontend application.

---

## ✨ Features

1. **Modular Problem Library** – categorized topics such as arrays, loops, closures, ES6, mini‑projects, and more.
2. **Interactive UI** – responsive design using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI components.
3. **AI Assistant** – ask questions about problems, receive hints, or request code examples via the integrated AI chatbot.
4. **Math & Utility Tools** – built‑in calculator and helper components to assist with problem solving.
5. **Authentication Hooks** – login/signup modals prepared for extension with real auth backends.
6. **Extensible Architecture** – add new categories or problems by editing simple `problems.ts`, `explanations.ts`, and `solvers.ts` files.
7. **TypeScript First** – full TypeScript support with strict typing and modern React patterns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Frontend | React 19.1.1 | UI library |
| Bundler | Vite 6.2.0 | Development & build tooling |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI | Utility‑first styling |
| AI | @google/genai / @google/generative‑ai | Generative AI integration |
| Language | TypeScript | Type safety |
| Utilities | mathjs, react-icons | Math operations & icons |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm or Yarn
- [Google Cloud API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enabled for the Generative AI API

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/<your‑username>/javascript-mastery-2825.git
cd javascript-mastery-2825

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root (note: this file is ignored by git):

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_GOOGLE_API_ENDPOINT=https://generativeai.googleapis.com/v1
```

The application reads these variables at build time for the AI assistant.

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173 in browser
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview           # serve the production build locally
```

> **Tip:** Add new topic folders under `src/problems/` following existing conventions to expand the question bank.

---

## 🧩 Adding Problems

The problem system is data‑driven. Each topic contains three exports:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `problems.ts` | Array of problem objects with `id`, `title`, and `description` |
| `explanations.ts` | Maps problem `id` to detailed written explanations |
| `solvers.ts` | Maps problem `id` to TypeScript reference implementations |

There is also a central `src/problems/index.ts` that aggregates all categories.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

Although there are no formal unit tests shipped, problems and solvers are designed to be easily testable using frameworks like Jest or Vitest. A `solvers.ts` file can be imported into a test suite to verify edge‑case behavior.

---

## 🎯 Future Roadmap

- ✅ Add user authentication with backend (Firebase, Supabase, etc.)
- ✅ Persist user progress & favorite problems
- ✅ Community contributions & problem submissions
- ✅ Mobile‑friendly UI enhancements
- 🔄 Support additional languages (Python, Java)
- 🤝 GitHub Actions for preview deployments

Contributions are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

---

## 📐 Coding Standards

- Follow the existing TypeScript interfaces (`types.ts`) for new code.
- Use functional React components with hooks.
- Keep CSS in Tailwind utility classes; avoid custom styles unless necessary.
- Format with Prettier & lint with ESLint (config not included but easy to add).
